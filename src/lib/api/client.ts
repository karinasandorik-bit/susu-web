/**
 * The HTTP client for `susu-api`.
 *
 * This is the only module in the app that talks to the backend, and it is
 * deliberately thin: build a URL, attach a token, parse a JSON body, and turn a
 * non-2xx response into an `ApiError`. Every decision about what a response
 * *means* belongs in the module that called it — invite codes mean nothing to a
 * generic transport.
 *
 * TOKENS ARE PASSED IN
 * The client never reads the session itself. A caller that needs authentication
 * supplies the token, which keeps this module free of Supabase and lets the tests
 * exercise every branch without a browser session or a network.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT
 * No retry, and no timeout. Retrying is a policy that depends on the operation —
 * retrying a redeemed invite is safe, retrying anything that claims a use is not
 * something this layer can judge — and the callers that need it use React Query,
 * which owns that policy. A silent client-side timeout would also be a lie about
 * what happened to the request: the browser cancels its interest, not the
 * request, so the server may still have acted.
